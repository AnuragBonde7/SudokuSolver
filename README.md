This repository contains a Java implementation of Java program for solving Sudoku puzzles using recursion and backtracking algorithms. Sudoku is a popular puzzle game where players fill a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all the digits without repetition. This solver utilizes recursive techniques to systematically explore possible solutions and backtracking to efficiently backtrack and correct incorrect choices.

Features:

Sudoku Solver Algorithm: Implements a recursive approach to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently.

Backtracking: Utilizes backtracking to backtrack from dead ends and explore alternative solutions.
